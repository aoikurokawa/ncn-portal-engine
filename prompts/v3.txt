Jito (Re)staking is a multi-asset staking protocol for Node Consensus Networks (NCNs) on Solana. It allows users to stake various SPL assets, receive liquid Vault Receipt Tokens (VRTs), and earn rewards from multiple networks. By combining the benefits of liquid staking with the flexibility of supporting various NCNs, Jito (Re)staking aims to enhance capital efficiency and create new opportunities in the Solana ecosystem.
